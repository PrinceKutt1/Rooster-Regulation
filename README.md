# Rooster-Regulation

This project uses the #Mocha test frame and #assert method to write a test for an object named #rooster
The project uses a #fast, #complete, #reliable, #isolated, #maintainable, and #expressive test suite to ensure that rooster is functioning correctly.


This will also act as a form of documentation for other developers
